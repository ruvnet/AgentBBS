# Door Games & MUDs - Candidate Research

Investigation notes for slowly adding more door games / MUDs to late.sh.
Status: **research only, nothing committed.** Last updated 2026-06-28.

## TL;DR

- **You wanted LORD but couldn't license it.** The legal, open-source answer is
  **Legend of the Green Dragon (LotGD)** - a faithful free remake of LORD. The
  catch: it's a PHP + MySQL *web* app, not a terminal door, so it needs work to
  fit our SSH model.
- **Easiest things that drop straight into our existing model:** **dopewars**
  (GPL, has a real curses terminal client + multiplayer server) and **Usurper**
  (GPL, LORD-like, already ported to 64-bit Linux). Both run as a normal process
  on a PTY - exactly how NetHack already works here.
- **TradeWars 2002 is a no-go on license** (proprietary, EIS/Pritchett own the
  trademark). The open path is **twclone** (MIT clone), which would be a port,
  not the real thing.
- **MUDs are parked** (see bottom). Almost all the demand is for *doors*, not
  MUDs, and MUDs fight late.sh's quick-session format. Licensing is fine if we
  ever want one (DikuMUD LGPL, Evennia BSD), but it's not on the roadmap.

## How a door has to plug into late.sh

We already have three integration patterns (see `docs/design/CONTEXT.md` §2.9-2.11 and
`late-ssh/src/app/door/`). Any candidate is judged against these:

1. **Native Rust port** - like **Lateania**. Most work, full control, no
   licensing of *code* needed if we reimplement gameplay (mechanics aren't
   copyrightable; assets/text are). Right call for something we want to own.
2. **Real upstream binary on a PTY, proxied over SSH** - like **NetHack**
   (`late-nethack` host crate + russh client in `door/nethack`). Best fit for
   any game that's already a Unix terminal program. This is the cheapest way to
   add a *real* existing game - if it builds and runs on Linux and talks to a
   TTY, we can wrap it almost exactly like NetHack.
3. **Remote SSH door proxy** - like **Rebels in the Sky** (`door/rebels`). For
   games that already expose an SSH/telnet server.

**Decision rule:** prefer pattern (2) for anything that's already a Linux
terminal binary under a clean license. Fall back to (1) for web/DOS-only games
worth owning. Licensing is the gate before any of this matters.

## License traffic light

### 🟢 Green - clean license, go

| Game | License | Notes / fit |
|---|---|---|
| **dopewars** | GPL | Drug Wars / Dope Wars done right. Has a **curses text client** and a client/server **multiplayer** mode. Pure Linux terminal program → **pattern 2, near-zero friction.** Copyright Ben Webb 1998-2022, still maintained. |
| **Usurper** | GPL | Classic LORD-style RPG door. Rick Parrish ported it to **32/64-bit** (orig by Jakob Dangarden). Runs on Linux → **pattern 2.** Good "second LORD-like" alongside LotGD. |
| **Legend of the Green Dragon (LotGD)** | GPL (≤0.9.7), Creative Commons (after) | **The open LORD.** Faithful remake. BUT it's **PHP + MySQL web**, not a terminal door → needs either a TUI front-end or a native port (**pattern 1**). Highest player-recognition payoff, highest effort. Active forks exist (incl. a Symfony rewrite). |
| **Wolfpack Empire** | GPLv3 | Classic large multiplayer strategy "Empire" door. Server + client, runs on Linux. Heavier/niche but clean. |
| **twclone** | MIT (v1.0.0, Dec 2025) | Independent TradeWars clone, **fully rewritten and now headless**: a TCP server with a **pure JSON protocol** and a **PostgreSQL** backend. No BBS, no DOSBox, no telnet/ANSI. The clean way to get TradeWars-like gameplay. See deep dive below. |

### 🟡 Yellow - usable but read the terms

| Game | License | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **GWT (Galactic Warriors Tournament)** | Source on GitHub, license unclear | Sci-fi LORD-like, source available; confirm license before use. |
| **Dominion** | Source on GitHub, license unclear | Fantasy RPG door; confirm license. |

### 🔴 Red - proprietary / licensing pain (avoid or port-only)

| Game | Why |
|---|---|
| **Legend of the Red Dragon (LORD)** | Proprietary (the licensing wall you already hit). Use **LotGD** or **Usurper** instead. |
| **TradeWars 2002** | Proprietary; EIS / John Pritchett hold trademark + rights. Would need a paid license. Use **twclone**. |
| **Barren Realms Elite / Solar Realms Elite** | Proprietary inter-BBS games (Jeff Graham / Galactic). No open source. Also designed as competitive inter-BBS, awkward for a single host. |
| **The Pit** | DOS gladiator door by James R. Berry / Midas Touch (1990; Berry died 1999). **No registration code is required to run it anymore**, so it's free to *play* - but the source is now owned by **BBSFiles.com**, with no open-source license, and there's **no clone/port**. So: same DOS-door stack as TW2002 (DOSBox + BBS + door32) and no code rights to embed or port. See note below. |
| **Land of Devastation, Arrowbridge I/II, Sinbad, Bordello, Yankee Trader** | Old proprietary/abandonware DOS doors. No clean license; only runnable via DOSBox wrappers (e.g. DoorNode) which doesn't grant rights. Treat as red unless an author releases source. |
| **DrugWars / Dope Wars (the originals)** | Originals are proprietary/abandonware - but **dopewars (green, above) is the GPL reimplementation**, so this is solved. |
| **Falcon's Eye** | Not a separate game - it's a **NetHack** frontend (graphical). We already run real NetHack; nothing new here. |

## TradeWars: deep dive (the one everybody asks for)

TradeWars comes up more than anything else, and trying to host the *real*
TW2002 is genuinely awful. Here's why, and the way out.

### Why proxying real TW2002 is so painful

TW2002 is a **DOS door**. To run the authentic game you need the whole stack:

- A BBS package (Synchronet / Mystic / WWIV) to act as the door host.
- **TWGS** (Trade Wars Game Server) - the standalone server build - which is
  **proprietary and paid**, and speaks **rlogin** on port 2002.
- DOSBox/DOSEMU + a **FOSSIL driver** + door32 plumbing to bridge the DOS
  binary to a socket.
- Then a telnet/rlogin -> SSH proxy on top to reach late.sh, plus **CP437 ->
  UTF-8** translation so the ANSI art doesn't turn into garbage.

That's four fragile layers and a license purchase before a single player logs
in. Someone already built the proxy half of this in Go - `erikh/trade`, an
"SSH -> telnet proxy, primarily for tradewars" that even does the CP437->UTF-8
fixups - which tells you this is a well-known pain point, not just us.

**Verdict on the real thing:** red. Proprietary server, DOS emulation, ANSI
mess. Not worth it.

### The actual answer: twclone (MIT, headless, JSON + Postgres)

`twclone` was **fully rewritten and released as v1.0.0 in Dec 2025**, and it's
now shaped almost perfectly for late.sh:

- **MIT licensed** - no permission needed, donations/chip economy is fine.
- **Headless TCP server, no BBS** - just run the server binary.
- **Pure JSON protocol** - "all client<->server interactions use JSON." No
  telnet, no ANSI, no CP437. Any language that speaks JSON can be a client.
- **PostgreSQL backend** - which late.sh already runs.
- Forked game-engine process for clocks/economy/NPCs; "100+ connections"
  out of the box.

**Why this is better than the NetHack/Rebels approach for TradeWars:** we don't
proxy a terminal at all. We run the twclone server alongside our Postgres and
write a **native Rust TUI client** (`door/tradewars`) that speaks JSON to it -
the same ownership level as Lateania, but we don't have to design the game. We
render the universe/ports/combat ourselves in ratatui, so it looks native to
late.sh instead of being a blitted foreign terminal. The JSON protocol means no
screen-scraping for milestones either (contrast NetHack, where we scrape vt100
for the Amulet/ascension) - we read game state straight off the wire.

**Open questions specific to twclone:**
- Does its JSON protocol expose enough state to render a full TUI, or is the
  bundled terminal client doing logic we'd have to reimplement? Read
  `data/menus.json` + the protocol spec first.
- Shared universe (one server, Lateania-style) vs. per-player - TW is
  inherently a shared persistent universe, so this is one global instance, not
  isolated NetHack-style sessions.
- Does it want its **own** Postgres or can it share ours with a schema/db
  separation? Prefer a separate database on the same instance.

## The Pit (the gladiator one)

Popular ask, but it lands the same place as real TW2002, just without the paid
server:

- DOS door by **James R. Berry / Midas Touch Software (1990)**; Berry died in
  1999. Warriors fight in an arena in Regal City vs. AI or other players. Had a
  fancy optional "Pit Terminal" front-end (EGA/MIDI) back in the day.
- **Free to run now** - the bundled `register.txt` says no registration code is
  required anymore. That removes the *paywall* but not the *copyright*: the
  source is owned by **BBSFiles.com** (reportedly being updated for modern OSes),
  under no open-source license.
- **No clone or port exists.** Unlike LORD->LotGD or DrugWars->dopewars, there's
  no clean reimplementation to lean on. The only GitHub artifacts are a v4.17
  registration patch and the old front-end - not a hostable codebase.

**Verdict:** red-ish. We *could* technically run the DOS binary through the same
DOSBox + door32 + proxy stack as TW2002 (and it's free of reg fees), but that's
exactly the painful path we're trying to avoid, and we'd have no rights to port
or modify it. Not worth it while dopewars/Usurper/twclone are clean wins. If we
ever want the gladiator-arena vibe, a **native Rust original** inspired by it
(mechanics aren't copyrightable) is the only sane route - and at that point it's
really a new Lateania-style game, not "The Pit."

## Recommended order of attack

1. **dopewars** - fastest real win. GPL, terminal-native, multiplayer. Wrap it
   like NetHack (`late-nethack`-style host or a local PTY child). Low risk, high
   "oh nice, Drug Wars" recognition.
2. **Usurper** - second easy PTY door, scratches the LORD-RPG itch with a clean
   license while we decide on LotGD.
3. **Legend of the Green Dragon** - the marquee "this is basically LORD" feature,
   but budget real effort: it's a web app, so either a native Rust port
   (Lateania-style) or a TUI shim over the PHP backend. Decide pattern before
   starting.
4. **TradeWars via twclone** - the most-requested game, finally tractable.
   Run the MIT twclone server next to our Postgres and write a native Rust JSON
   client. More work than dopewars but no licensing/DOS/BBS nightmare, and the
   payoff is the game people keep asking for. Do the protocol spike first (see
   deep dive) before committing.
MUDs are intentionally **not** in this list anymore - see Parked below.

## Open questions before building anything

- For LotGD: native Rust port vs. running the PHP app behind a TUI shim? Port is
  more work but matches how we own Lateania; shim is faster but drags in
  PHP/MySQL infra.
- Commercial/non-commercial: late.sh has a chip economy and may take donations -
  the non-commercial MUD licenses (Circle/Merc/ROM) need a real read before use.
  The green-list games (GPL/BSD/MIT/LGPL) are safe on this axis.
- Multiplayer state: dopewars/Wolfpack have their own servers - decide whether
  each player gets an isolated instance (NetHack-style) or shares one persistent
  world (Lateania-style).

## Parked: MUDs (low demand, not on the roadmap)

Researched, deliberately shelved. **Almost all the demand we've seen is for
doors, not MUDs.** MUDs also fight late.sh's format: a door is a quick
self-contained session that drops next to NetHack/Lateania, while a MUD wants to
be your whole evening and competes with our own chat/rooms. People who want a
MUD already have hundreds of live ones to go to; nobody's nostalgic for a *dead*
MUD the way they are for a vanished door.

If interest ever shows up, the licensing is already clear:

- **DikuMUD** (gamma/alpha/II) - **LGPL since 2020.** The classic combat-MUD base.
- **Evennia** - **BSD 3-Clause.** Modern Python framework; best for *building* a
  new world rather than running a 90s one. Connect with any MUD client on `:4000`.
- **CircleMUD / tbaMUD** - custom non-commercial + attribution (inherits Diku
  terms). The non-commercial clause matters given our chip economy/donations.
- **Merc / ROM** - custom Diku-derived; ROM requires credits in the login screen.

Likely integration would be **pattern 3** (remote proxy over telnet/MUD-client),
not a native port.
