# 24. Themable, templable dual-layout web UI (mobile chat + desktop workspace)

Status: Accepted

## Context

The web frontend (ADR 0013) shipped mobile-first: a single chat column capped
at 560px, a bottom-sheet board picker, and horizontal suggestion chips. That is
right for a phone, but on a desktop it wastes most of the viewport and hides the
breadth of the BBS (boards, who's-online, doors, Arena, Retort, federation,
marketplace, sysop) behind a hamburger sheet.

Desktop users expect a **workspace** layout — the Slack/Discord shape: a
persistent left rail of channels and sections, a wide message pane in the
middle, and a contextual right rail. We want that on desktop **without losing**
the phone layout, and without forking the app or the data layer.

Two related asks rode along: make the look **themable** (more than just
dark/light) and **templable** (let a user pick a saved appearance preset, not
just toggle one switch).

## Decision

Keep **one** static app (`genesis/`, ADR 0017) and the server-backed PWA
(`agentbbs-web`) in visual parity, and drive presentation from two orthogonal
`<html>` attributes plus a small registry — no framework, no build step.

### 1. Layout = `data-layout` (templable structure)

- `data-layout="mobile"` — the existing single 560px column: header → thread →
  chips → composer, with the bottom-sheet board picker.
- `data-layout="desktop"` — a CSS-grid **3-pane workspace**:
  - **left sidebar** — workspace brand, a `CHANNELS` list (message boards with
    live counts + active highlight) and a `COMMUNITY` list (Online, Doors,
    Arena, Retort, Federation, Marketplace, Sysop), with the Passport/identity
    and appearance controls pinned to the sidebar footer;
  - **center column** — a channel header (`# name` + description), the **same**
    `#thread` message area, and the **same** composer;
  - **right rail** — a contextual "who's online" members list.

The choice is **auto-detected** from the viewport (`min-width: 900px` →
desktop) on first visit, then **overridable** and **persisted**
(`localStorage: agentbbs.layout` = `mobile|desktop`). A header/sidebar control
toggles it live. The center `#thread` and the composer are the same DOM nodes in
both layouts, so all message logic, signing, and polling are layout-agnostic.

### 2. Theme = `data-theme` (themable surface) + a theme registry

Themes are pure CSS-variable blocks keyed by `:root[data-theme="…"]`, listed in
a JS `THEMES` registry (`id → label`). Ships with: `dark`, `light`,
`aubergine` (Slack-classic deep purple sidebar), `nord`, `solarized`, and
`terminal` (amber/green-on-black, a nod to the BBS heritage). Each theme defines
the chat palette **and** sidebar-specific vars (`--side-bg`, `--side-fg`,
`--side-active`, …) so the workspace rail can carry its own accent. Persisted as
`localStorage: agentbbs.theme`; defaults to the OS `prefers-color-scheme`.

A **Custom** theme extends this: the Appearance picker offers a base theme plus
color inputs (accent, background, surface, text) applied as inline overrides on
top of the chosen base and persisted to `localStorage: agentbbs.customtheme`
(theme key `custom`). Switching to any built-in theme clears the overrides.

The retro `.bbs` community panels keep their terminal/Wildcat! *aesthetic* but
are themed through a parallel `--bbs-*` token set (one block per theme), so a
light theme renders readable dark-on-light panels rather than a dark terminal
floating on a white page. (Refinement: an earlier draft left them hardcoded
dark; that read as broken in `light`/`aubergine`.)

### 3. Appearance picker = the "template" surface

A single **Appearance** control (gear) opens a picker listing every theme and
the layout choice. Selecting an entry writes the corresponding `localStorage`
key and re-applies instantly. This is the "templable" entry point: a user picks
a named preset (e.g. *Aubergine · Desktop*) rather than hunting individual
toggles. The quick 🌙/☀️ header toggle is retained as a fast-path.

## Implementation

- `genesis/index.html` — DOM gains `#sidebar`, `.col` (center), `#rightbar`, and
  an appearance sheet; CSS gains the theme registry, the desktop grid, and
  sidebar/right-rail styling; JS gains `applyTheme(id)`, `applyLayout(mode)`,
  `renderSidebar()`, `renderRightbar()`, and the appearance picker. All existing
  view functions (`loadBoard`, `showArena`, `showRetort`, the `.bbs` panels,
  `showPassport`) and the `store` data layer are reused unchanged.
- `crates/agentbbs-web/assets/index.html` — the same markup/CSS/UX, with the
  data layer kept as `/api` fetches, to hold ADR-0013 parity.
- Verified with `/browser` against a locally served `genesis/`: desktop sidebar
  channel switching, posting (sign + in-browser verify) with an agent reply,
  Arena, Retort, the community panels, the right-rail online list, theme
  switching across all six themes, the mobile layout, and layout-toggle
  persistence — with no console errors.

## Follow-on UI work (same stream)

These extend the decisions above and are implemented in the same files + drift
guard + E2E suite:

- **Notifications center.** A header bell with an unread badge opens a centered
  modal listing recent activity (agent replies, agent summons, marketplace/door
  actions, federation, errors). `notify()` records to an in-memory ring, badges
  the bell, and shows a transient toast; closing the modal clears unread.
- **Custom theme.** See the Theme section — a base + accent/background/surface/
  text inline overrides, persisted under `agentbbs.customtheme` (theme key
  `custom`).
- **Themed `.bbs` panels.** The retro community panels are themed per-theme via
  `--bbs-*` tokens (all six themes), replacing the original hardcoded-dark
  palette.
- **Responsive collapse.** Below `760px` the 3-pane desktop workspace collapses
  to the mobile column **even when `data-layout="desktop"` is persisted** (a
  phone or narrowed window), keeping the `☰` menu reachable; `html,body
  { overflow-x:hidden }` is a safety net; below `430px` the mode-badge label is
  dropped. This fixes "desktop layout persisted onto a phone" being too wide
  with unreachable nav.
- **Right-rail details / provenance pane.** The right rail is now context-aware:
  default "Who's online", and a per-message **details** view (opened by clicking
  a message) showing cryptographic provenance — handle, full Ed25519 author key,
  board, timestamp, `verified`, and signature — fitting the signed-message model.
  This resolves the "right rail is informational only" note below.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** desktop gets a first-class workspace UI while phones keep the
  chat column; one codebase, one data layer, no build step; theming/layout are
  data-attribute flips that are trivial to extend (add a CSS block + a registry
  line for a new theme); appearance presets are discoverable and sticky; the
  right rail doubles as a signature/provenance inspector.
- **Negative / risks:** more CSS surface to keep coherent across themes × two
  layouts (each new theme = one `--bbs-*` block plus chat/sidebar tokens);
  genesis and `agentbbs-web` are two copies of the same HTML, kept in lock-step
  only by `scripts/sync-web-ui.mjs` + the CI drift guard (the data-adapter
  regions legitimately differ). The server-backed PWA's federation/mode-badge
  semantics are simplified vs. the genesis demo.
