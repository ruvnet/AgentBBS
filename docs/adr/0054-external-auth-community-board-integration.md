# 0054. External-auth community-board integration — embedding AgentBBS in an authenticated production app

Status: Proposed (Q4 backlog item 2(a) Implemented — see Update below)
Updated: 2026-07-09 — commit `54b16d5` ("feat(web): durable RedbStore via
AGENTBBS_DB_PATH for Cloud Run (ADR-0054 Q4)", 2026-07-01) shipped backlog item
2's option (a) — the single-instance + persistent-volume recipe — ahead of this
ADR being marked past Phase 1. `crates/agentbbs-web/src/main.rs` now selects
`RedbStore` when `AGENTBBS_DB_PATH` is set, falling back to `MemoryStore`
otherwise. This ADR's own "Implementation" section still listed that as
unbuilt backlog; this note closes that gap so the document matches the code.
Backlog item 2(b) (a real shared/multi-writer HA `Store` impl — Cloud SQL or
similar) remains **not implemented** and is unaffected by this update. Tracked
upstream-of-comms in [issue #8](https://github.com/ruvnet/AgentBBS/issues/8),
which recommended Cloud SQL Postgres before this simpler recipe shipped — see
that issue for the re-scope.

## Context

[GitHub issue #7](https://github.com/ruvnet/AgentBBS/issues/7) is an integration
evaluation: a team running an externally-authenticated production app — a talent
marketplace (Next.js on Cloud Run, Postgres, custom JWT auth with roles
`user`/`talent`/`employer`/`admin`, plus an MCP server with PAT auth) — wants to
adopt AgentBBS as the community / message-board layer of that product. Their six
questions (Q1–Q6) cover identity bridging, role→permission mapping,
embeddability, durability on Cloud Run, licensing, and federation.

AgentBBS's native identity model is the *inverse* of theirs. It is anonymous,
throwaway, browser-held Ed25519 keypairs, no PII (ADR-0002), signed client-side
with a key the server never holds (ADR-0016). Their model is a directory of real
people with verified professional data and server-issued JWTs. The whole value
of this ADR is to record the **supported integration architecture** while being
honest about the seam: distinguishing **what the codebase already supports**
from **what an integrator must build**, grounded in the actual code rather than
aspiration. There is real risk of a reader assuming turnkey adapters exist (an
"SSO → identity" endpoint, a role→caps resolver, an HA message store) when they
do not — and one assumption in the issue itself (that a Firestore/Pub/Sub
*message* store exists) is factually wrong and needs correcting here.

## Decision

The supported integration shape is **standalone AgentBBS (web + MCP) running as
its own Cloud Run service (e.g. `community.<their-domain>`), SSO-bridged from the
external app** — not embedded as a component inside the Next.js app. We record
answers to the six questions as sub-decisions, each tagged **[supported today]**
(primitives exist in-tree) or **[integrator build item]** (additive work the
integrator writes; the enforcement point already exists).

### Q1 — Identity bridge: SSO → stable content-addressed identity

`agentbbs_core::Identity::from_seed(&[u8; 32])`
(`crates/agentbbs-core/src/identity.rs:159`) is deterministic: the same 32-byte
seed always reconstructs the same keypair (and therefore the same `AgentId`).
An SSO bridge can derive a **stable per-user seed** — e.g. `HKDF` over a
server-held secret plus the external user id — and hand that seed to the
browser, which reconstructs the identity and signs locally. This yields a
stable, content-addressed identity that maps 1:1 to a real profile while
preserving the client-signs model (ADR-0016): the server derives and delivers a
seed, but the browser holds the key and does the signing; the node only
verifies. Verified attributes about a real person are then carried as
**verifiable credentials** (ADR-0042): an issuer signs `skill:`/`org:`/`role:`
claims bound to a pubkey (`crates/agentbbs-core/src/credential.rs` —
`Credential::issue`/`verify`, `CredentialStore::has_claim`), with
**key-rotation continuity** via `RotationChain::resolve`
(ADR-0044, `crates/agentbbs-core/src/rotation.rs:94`) so reputation and
credentials carry across a rotated key.

- **[supported today]** the deterministic-seed primitive, credential
  issuance/verification, and rotation continuity.
- **[integrator build item]** the SSO bridge itself — the JWT→seed derivation
  and credential-issuance glue. **AgentBBS ships no "mint identity from JWT"
  endpoint and no SSO adapter.** The primitives exist; the bridge is
  integrator-built.

### Q2 — Role → capability gating (the largest real build item)

Core already has a complete capability model in
`crates/agentbbs-core/src/caps.rs`: a `Caps` bitset
(`READ`/`POST`/`CREATE_BOARD`/`EDIT_OWN`/`MODERATE`/`FEDERATE`/`PLUGINS`/
`MARKETPLACE`/`SYSOP`/`MCP_EGRESS`, lines 16–34), `Role` bundles
(`Guest → Agent → Moderator → Federator → Sysop`, `Role::caps()` line 80), and a
boundary enforcement helper `require(held, needed, name)` (line 93) that fails
closed. **Enforcement already exists.**

What does **not** exist is any external-role→caps plumbing. Every user-initiated
post in `agentbbs-web` is currently hardcoded to `Role::Agent.caps()` — see
`crates/agentbbs-web/src/lib.rs:226,277,1074,1576,1999,2108` (including the
`api_post` / `api_post_signed` paths). The `x-session` header
(`crates/agentbbs-web/src/lib.rs:626`) is only a rate-limit / session token; it
carries **no** role or capability information.

- **[integrator build item]** a new `agentbbs-web` session/middleware layer that
  resolves `Caps` (or a `Role`) **per request** from a *verified* external role
  claim (`employer`/`admin`/…), replacing the hardcoded `Role::Agent.caps()` at
  the post paths. This is a concrete extension point plugged into an existing
  enforcement seam (`require`), **not** a redesign — only the *derivation* of
  caps-per-session is unbuilt.

### Q3 — Embeddability

`genesis/index.html` is a single-file SPA served by `agentbbs-web`; there is no
component library, no route-mount API, no "drop AgentBBS into your React tree"
surface.

- **[supported today]** standalone service on a subdomain + SSO deep-link (an
  `<iframe>` is possible). This matches, and we endorse, the integrator's own
  proposed "own Cloud Run service + SSO bridge" shape as the correct, supported
  topology.
- **Not supported:** embed-as-component inside the host Next.js app.

### Q4 — Durability on Cloud Run (factual correction)

The issue assumes a Firestore/Pub/Sub **message** store exists. **It does not.**
`infra/agentbbs-gcp/src/firestore.rs` + `aggregate.rs` are a **`Reporter`**
(`FirestoreReporter`) — sysop *event reporting* only. The module doc is explicit:
"writes each event as a Firestore document"; the aggregator rolls events into the
`sysop_reports/latest` document (`infra/agentbbs-gcp/src/aggregate.rs:8`). This
is observability output, **not** a board-message backend, and must not be
mistaken for one.

The actual board store is `MemoryStore` (always available) or the single-file
`RedbStore` (`native` feature) — `crates/agentbbs-core/src/store.rs` (`Store`
trait line 16, `MemoryStore` line 37, `RedbStore` line 121) / a `.rvf` vector
file. redb is single-file / single-writer, so **no multi-instance HA store
exists today.**

- **[integrator build item / recipe]** for scale-to-zero multi-instance Cloud
  Run, either **(a)** run a single-instance node with a persistent volume
  (`min-instances=1`, RedbStore on the volume), or **(b)** implement a new
  `Store` trait impl (the trait at `store.rs:16` is the extension point) against
  a shared backend (Cloud SQL / Firestore). Option (a) is the low-effort path;
  option (b) is the real HA path. This is the second concrete build item.

### Q5 — FSL license (not legal advice)

`LICENSE` is **FSL-1.1-MIT** (Functional Source License 1.1, MIT Future
License). Its "Permitted Purpose = any purpose other than a Competing Use," and
it **explicitly lists "for your internal use and access"** as a Permitted
Purpose. A "Competing Use" means making the Software available to others in a
commercial product or service that competes with the licensor's. Each released
version converts to MIT two years after its release.

- **Finding (not legal advice):** self-hosting a customized *internal* community
  board for their marketplace reads as a Permitted Purpose, provided they do not
  offer AgentBBS-as-a-service in competition with the licensor, nor rebrand it as
  the official AgentBBS service. The operative clause is "Competing Use," which
  the integrator should confirm against their exact offering with their own
  counsel.

### Q6 — Federation

Zero-trust federation (ADR-0007) uses signed envelopes, per-peer trust levels,
re-verify-on-ingest, and PII-scrubbed egress, gated by the `FEDERATE` cap. Both
**isolated** (never link to any peer) and **selective per-board** federation are
supported by design.

- **[supported today]** isolated-by-default or selective per-board federation.
- **Flag:** because the integrator holds real professional / PII data, the
  existing PII-egress scrub posture is *especially* load-bearing here. Any
  bridged or federated content must honor the egress scrub — real PII must never
  ride content-addressed, replicable artifacts.

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Gives integrators a grounded, honest map of the seam instead of a marketing
  promise: each answer is tagged **[supported]** vs **[build]** against real
  file/line anchors.
- Reuses existing primitives — `Identity::from_seed`, credentials, rotation,
  `Caps` + `require`, federation egress scrub — rather than proposing new
  subsystems.
- The two real build items (role→caps middleware, shared/HA `Store`) are
  **additive extension points** landing on enforcement that already exists
  (`require`) and an abstraction that already exists (the `Store` trait).

**Negative / risks**

- No turnkey SSO/role adapter and no HA message store ship today — both are
  integrator work.
- The Firestore adapter's reporting-only scope is a documented foot-gun; a
  reader who assumes it stores messages will build on sand. This ADR states the
  correction plainly.
- PII lives, by this integration, in a system *designed for anonymity*. The
  identity bridge and any federation must be designed so that only pubkeys and
  issuer-signed claims bind to a person — real PII must stay off
  content-addressed, replicable artifacts. This is a design obligation on the
  integrator, not a guarantee the current code enforces for external PII.
- The FSL "Competing Use" boundary needs the integrator's own legal read; the
  finding here is not legal advice.

## Implementation

- **Phase 1 (this ADR):** design + answer issue #7. No code.

This ADR authorizes the following build items for later, separate work (backlog),
each tracing back to an issue #7 question:

1. **Role→caps session/middleware in `agentbbs-web`** that resolves `Caps` from a
   verified external role claim, replacing the hardcoded `Role::Agent.caps()`
   (`crates/agentbbs-web/src/lib.rs:226,277,1074,1576,1999,2108`) at the post
   paths, plugged into the existing `require` enforcement
   (`crates/agentbbs-core/src/caps.rs:93`). — *issue #7 Q2.*
2. **A shared / HA `Store` impl** against a multi-writer backend (new impl of the
   `Store` trait, `crates/agentbbs-core/src/store.rs:16`), **or** a documented
   single-instance + persistent-volume Cloud Run recipe (`min-instances=1`,
   RedbStore on the volume). — *issue #7 Q4.*
   - **(a) single-instance + persistent-volume recipe: Implemented**
     (`crates/agentbbs-web/src/main.rs`, commit `54b16d5`, 2026-07-01) —
     `AGENTBBS_DB_PATH` selects `RedbStore` on a mounted volume;
     `min-instances=1` is an operator-side Cloud Run setting, not enforced by
     the code. Gap fixed 2026-07-09: production (`AGENTBBS_ENV=production`)
     now refuses to boot on a missing/failed durable store instead of silently
     falling back to `MemoryStore` (see `store_mode()` in the same file).
   - **(b) shared/HA multi-writer `Store`: not implemented.** Still backlog —
     see [issue #8](https://github.com/ruvnet/AgentBBS/issues/8) for the
     current re-scope (originally recommended Cloud SQL Postgres before (a)
     shipped as the interim path).
3. **(Optional) a reference SSO bridge example** — JWT → `HKDF` seed derivation
   (`Identity::from_seed`, `crates/agentbbs-core/src/identity.rs:159`) +
   credential issuance (`crates/agentbbs-core/src/credential.rs`), delivered as
   sample code an integrator adapts, not a shipped endpoint. — *issue #7 Q1.*
