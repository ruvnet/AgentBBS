// Lateania world runtime: the authoritative, in-memory truth for the server-wide
// MUD world.
//
// One service is shared by the process. Sessions join it only while the
// dedicated Lateania page is open; each has its own `state::State`. Mutations
// serialize through `Arc<Mutex<WorldState>>`; reads are lock-free against each
// session's cached snapshot. A background tick loop advances combat rounds,
// effects, resource regen, and respawns, then publishes a fresh snapshot.
//
// Systems wired here: five classes with a 50-level progression and a passive
// trait (classes.rs), abilities and spells unified under one effect resolver
// (abilities.rs), and an inventory / equipment / gold / shop economy (items.rs).
