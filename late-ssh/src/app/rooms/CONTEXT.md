# Rooms Context

## Metadata
- Scope: `late-ssh/src/app/rooms`
- Last updated: 2026-05-13
- Purpose: local working context for the persistent game-room directory and trait-backed room game runtimes.

## Source Map
- `mod.rs` only declares modules. Keep it declaration-only; do not add `pub use` re-exports.
- `backend.rs` defines the room-game traits: `RoomGameManager` for static/table-manager behavior, `ActiveRoomBackend` for per-session active-room behavior, and `RoomGameEvent` for cross-game runtime events such as successful seat joins.
- `registry.rs` owns the process-local `RoomGameRegistry`, dispatches `GameKind` to Blackjack/Poker/Tic-Tac-Toe managers, and starts the shared `#general` seat-join announcer.
- `svc.rs` owns persistent room creation/listing/deletion over `game_rooms` plus associated `chat_rooms(kind='game')`. It stores opaque `settings: serde_json::Value`; games parse their own settings. Slug prefixes and human-readable labels are resolved from `RoomGameRegistry` at the call site and passed into room creation; `svc.rs` does not match on `GameKind` for either.
- `state.rs` drains `RoomsService` snapshots/events into `App` fields, clamps list selection, and refreshes the active room copy.
- `input.rs` routes the room directory, create form, search mode, active table, and embedded room-chat keys.
- `ui.rs` renders the directory, create modal, active room split, and delegates game drawing.
- `filter.rs` is pure filter state over `All` or a real `GameKind`.
- `blackjack/manager.rs` maps `GameRoom.id` to process-local `BlackjackService` instances.
- `blackjack/svc.rs` is the authoritative in-memory Blackjack table runtime.
- `blackjack/state.rs` is the per-session client wrapper plus pure Blackjack scoring/bet logic.
- `blackjack/ui.rs` renders the Blackjack table in fancy or compact layouts.
- `blackjack/settings.rs` serializes table pace/stake settings into `game_rooms.settings`.
- `blackjack/player.rs` loads username and chip balance data for seated players.
- `poker/manager.rs` maps `GameRoom.id` to process-local `PokerService` instances.
- `poker/svc.rs` is the authoritative in-memory Poker table runtime and owns the public/private snapshot split.
- `poker/state.rs` is the per-session Poker client wrapper that drains both public table state and private hole-card state.
- `poker/ui.rs` renders the Blackjack-shaped Poker table with dealer/board top and four seats below.
- `tictactoe/manager.rs` maps `GameRoom.id` to process-local `TicTacToeService` instances.
- `tictactoe/svc.rs` is the authoritative in-memory Tic-Tac-Toe board runtime.
- `tictactoe/state.rs` is the per-session Tic-Tac-Toe client wrapper.
- `tictactoe/ui.rs` renders the Tic-Tac-Toe board and seats.
- Global user-action activity lives outside Rooms in `late-ssh/src/app/activity`. The room `touch_activity` methods below are inactivity timers only. Blackjack, Poker, and Tic-Tac-Toe win outcomes publish structured `ActivityEvent::game_won(...)` values through `ActivityPublisher`; add future room-game challenge signals there instead of overloading room touch state.

## Persistence Model
- `late_core::models::game_room::GameKind` is a Rust enum over text. It currently has `Blackjack`, `Poker`, and `TicTacToe`.
- A game room persists in `game_rooms`; its chat pane is backed by a unique `chat_room_id` pointing at `chat_rooms(kind='game', visibility='public', auto_join=false, game_kind, slug)`.
- `GameRoom::create_with_chat_room` creates the chat room and game room in one SQL CTE. `RoomsService::create_game_room` then joins the fixed dealer user to that game chat.
- `RoomsService` publishes `RoomsSnapshot { rooms: Vec<RoomListItem> }` through `watch` and transient `RoomsEvent` values through `broadcast`.
- `late-ssh/src/main.rs` calls `rooms_service.refresh_task()` at startup before the hourly inactive-table cleanup loop is started.
- Room creation is capped at 3 non-closed tables per creator per game kind.
- `RoomsService::cleanup_inactive_tables_task` runs hourly and marks tables `closed` after 12h without a `game_rooms.updated` touch.
- Entering any real room calls `RoomsService::touch_room_task(room.id)`.
- Deleting a room is a soft close through `GameRoom::close_by_id`; closed rows disappear because snapshots use `GameRoom::list_open`.

## Directory Behavior
- The Rooms screen is key `3`.
- The list contains real `game_rooms`; placeholder rows were removed when Tic-Tac-Toe shipped.
- Filters cycle through `All` and each real `GameKind`.
- Search is a case-insensitive substring match on `RoomListItem.display_name`.
- `rooms_selected_index` counts only visible real rooms.
- `state.rs::visible_real_rooms_count` and `input.rs::visible_real_count`/`visible_real_room_at` intentionally duplicate the same filter/search predicate. Change them together.
- Wide directory layout starts at `NARROW_WIDTH = 80` and renders a columned table. Narrow layout renders two-line cards.
- Directory handlers support `j/k` and up/down arrows to navigate, `h/l` and left/right arrows to filter, `/` to search, `n` to create, `d` to delete, and `Enter` to enter. The rendered footer is role-aware: `n` always shows, `d` shows only for admins, and `Esc` shows only for admins/mods.
- In the idle directory, `Tab`, `Shift+Tab`, and number keys remain global screen navigation, not Rooms filter shortcuts. The create modal consumes `Tab`/`BackTab` for field focus, and active-room input is intercepted before global screen switching.
- Directory `Esc` peels state in this order: create form -> active search -> search query -> non-All filter -> active room/list exit. Active rooms bypass that directory escape path: `Esc` first clears embedded chat selection when present, then routes to the game and may leave the room.
- Create/search input limits: room name max 48 chars, search query max 32 chars, default create names come from `RoomGameRegistry`, and pasted text is passed through paste-marker sanitization.

## Access Policy
- Room creation is open to every user for Blackjack, Poker, and Tic-Tac-Toe. The 3-non-closed-tables-per-creator-per-game-kind cap is enforced server-side in `RoomsService::create_game_room`; over-cap attempts surface to the client via `RoomsEvent::Error` (banner).
- Room deletion is admin-only in `input.rs` (`can_delete_room`).
- Room entry is open to every user for Blackjack, Poker, and Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Create modal lets any user pick a real game kind. Blackjack-specific pace/stake fields render only when Blackjack is selected; Poker-specific pace/blind fields render only when Poker is selected; Tic-Tac-Toe uses empty JSON settings.

## Active Room and Chat
- Entering a room calls:
  - `app.chat.join_game_room_chat(room.chat_room_id)`
  - `app.chat.request_room_tail(room.chat_room_id)`
  - `app.rooms_service.touch_room_task(room.id)`
  - `app.room_game_registry.enter(&room, app.user_id, app.chip_balance)` when the active backend is not already for the same `room.id`
- Game-chat joining is async. `ChatEvent::GameRoomJoined` triggers a chat `request_list()` refresh and another tail request after the membership write lands.
- The active room area is a vertical split: preferred game height, one spacer, then an embedded chat pane.
- The bottom pane is no longer just a placeholder; `render.rs` builds `EmbeddedRoomChatView` from the associated game chat room and `rooms/ui.rs` calls `chat::ui::draw_embedded_room_chat`.
- Active room key routing lets embedded chat own composer/message actions first for keys like `i`, `j/k`, scroll, reactions, copy, reply/edit/delete, and selection escape.
- Arrow keys are routed to the active game backend first; only if the backend declines (returns `false`) do they fall through to embedded chat message selection. Backends that don't override `handle_arrow` (e.g. Blackjack) keep the prior chat-first behavior.
- The active `ActiveRoomBackend` receives remaining game keys. `q` leaves active Blackjack/Poker rooms by their backend/input implementations.
- The outer Rooms title appends active-room status from backend `title_details`: room name, seated count, role/seat label, and optional chip balance.
- `App.active_room_game` is the single per-session active game backend. Do not add per-game `Option<State>` fields to `App`.

## Room Game Events
- `RoomGameManager::subscribe_room_events` is the cross-game event interface. Every concrete room-game manager must expose a `broadcast::Receiver<RoomGameEvent>`.
- Successful first-time seating emits `RoomGameEvent::SeatJoined { room_id, user_id, game_kind, display_name, seat_index }`. Repeated sit presses by an already seated user must not emit another join event.
- `RoomGameRegistry::start_general_seat_announcer_task` is started from `main.rs`. It listens to all manager event streams and posts a normal `#general` chat message from the seated user via `ChatService::send_general_message_task`.
- The announcer sanitizes room display names for a single-line message and neutralizes `@` mentions. Individual games must not know about chat or post directly.
- The registry suppresses repeated `(user_id, room_id)` seat announcements for 60 seconds to avoid reconnect or leave/rejoin spam.

## Home Integration
- `dashboard::ui::top_dashboard_rooms(&RoomsSnapshot, &RoomGameRegistry, 4)` selects up to four multiplayer rooms for the Home lounge multiplayer box by occupied-seat count descending, game priority Poker -> Blackjack -> Tic-Tac-Toe, then total seats descending.
- The lounge multiplayer box displays those rooms as active-table shortcuts with `b1`, `b2`, and `b3`.
- The global `b` prefix in `app/input.rs` delegates to `rooms::input::enter_room`, then switches to `Screen::Rooms`, so table touch, chat join/tail load, and runtime setup are shared with the directory path.
- Backtick toggles Dashboard/Home <-> the last active game target. Room-backed tables set the target to `DashboardGameToggleTarget::Room`; Arcade games under `late-ssh/src/app/arcade` set it to `DashboardGameToggleTarget::Arcade`. `rooms::input::enter_room` records `App.rooms_last_active_room_id`; Dashboard resolves room targets against the current `RoomsSnapshot`, while active-room backtick returns to Dashboard without clearing `rooms_active_room`.
- Direct global screen jump `3` opens the Rooms directory, not the active room. It clears `App.rooms_active_room` but keeps `rooms_last_active_room_id`, so backtick remains the way to return to the last game room.

## Blackjack Table Runtime
- `BlackjackTableManager` is process-local. It lazily maps each entered `GameRoom.id` to a `BlackjackService`.
- Restarting the SSH process drops all in-memory table state. Existing open `game_rooms` survive, but re-entering creates a fresh runtime table.
- `BlackjackService` owns the table truth: seats, shoe, dealer hand, phase, deadlines, stakes, pending bets, and settlements.
- `blackjack::State` is only a per-session client wrapper around service snapshots/events.
- `BlackjackPlayerDirectory` reads `late_core::models::blackjack::BlackjackPlayer` so seats can carry `BlackjackPlayerInfo { user_id, username, balance }`.
- Player info is loaded from DB on sit. Accepted bets and settlements update the seated player's balance in-place; if no player info was hydrated, the service may synthesize a fallback username of `player`. Rendering should read `BlackjackSeat.player`; do not add per-render DB/chip lookups.
- There are four seats. Entering a room starts as a viewer. `s` or `Enter` sits in the first open seat.
- `l` leaves a seat when safe. Locked/pending bets block leaving during active phases, but settled players may leave during `Phase::Settling`.
- Seated players build a shared visible stake through service-owned `SeatState.stake_chips`.
- Chip selection is client-local (`selected_chip_index`). Thrown stake chips are service-owned and appear in every subscriber's `BlackjackSeat.stake_chips`. Re-entering the same active Blackjack room from Dashboard/Rooms reuses the existing client `blackjack::State` so selected chip, private notices, and subscription cursors do not reset; entering a different table still creates a fresh client wrapper.
- Betting keys: `[`/`a` selects previous chip, `]`/`d` selects next chip, Space throws the selected chip, Backspace pulls one chip, `c`/Ctrl+W clears, `Enter`/`s` submits.
- Player action keys: `h`/Space hits, `s` stands, and `d`/`D` doubles down when eligible.
- Table stake settings are `10`, `50`, `100`, or `500` chips. `min_bet` is the stake and `max_bet` is `stake * 10`.
- Table pace settings (`Quick`, `Standard`, `Chill`) control the player action timeout only: 2m, 5m, or 10m.
- The first confirmed bet starts a fixed 30s betting cap (`BETTING_LOCK_CAP_SECS`). It does not restart on later bets. If all seated players have locked bets, the round deals immediately.
- Pending async chip debits can delay auto-deal; the service waits until no pending bets remain.
- During `PlayerTurn`, all betting seats can hit/stand/double their own hands in parallel. Dealer resolution runs after every unresolved hand has stood, busted, or naturally settled.
- Dealer resolution reveals/draws one card per step with a 900ms service-side delay (`DEALER_CARD_DELAY_MS`).
- After settlement, next-hand input is blocked for 1200ms (`SETTLEMENT_MIN_VIEW_MS`) in both the service and per-session client state so everyone can see the result.
- Double down is allowed only on an active two-card hand with a locked bet and enough chip balance for one extra wager equal to the original bet. The service marks the seat `SeatPhase::ActionPending` while the extra chip debit is pending, then doubles the recorded bet, draws exactly one card, and auto-stands or bust-settles the hand. Double-down settlement uses the doubled bet amount.
- Action timeout auto-stands remaining hands when the pace-specific deadline expires, then removes those non-acting seats after settlement.
- A seated player who misses 3 deals without a locked bet is removed from the table.
- A seated player who sends no active-room input for 5 minutes is removed from the table; active-room keys, arrows, and scrolls refresh this room timer while seated.
- Settlements use `ChipService`: zero-credit losses call `restore_floor`, payouts call `credit_payout`, and `BlackjackEvent::HandSettled` updates client balances.
- Winning Blackjack settlements (`PlayerWin` or `PlayerBlackjack`) publish `ActivityGame::Blackjack` events with the bet in `detail`.
- House rules: 6-deck shoe, reshuffle at 52-card penetration, dealer stands on soft 17, natural blackjack requires exactly two cards, and blackjack pays 3:2.
- `Phase::BetPending` exists in the shared enum and input/UI paths, but current pending debit state is expressed per seat as `SeatPhase::BetPending`; the service does not currently transition the whole table into `Phase::BetPending`.
- `BlackjackService::deal_task` exists as a manual deal API, but active room input does not currently route a key to it. Normal play deals by all seated players locking bets or by the 30s betting cap.

## Tic-Tac-Toe Runtime
- `TicTacToeTableManager` is process-local and lazily maps each entered `GameRoom.id` to a `TicTacToeService`.
- Restarting the SSH process drops in-memory board state. Existing open `game_rooms` survive, but re-entering creates a fresh board.
- There are two seats: X and O. Entering starts as a viewer; `s`, `Space`, or `Enter` sits when not seated.
- Seated players can press `1`-`9` to place directly, move a local cursor with `w/a/s/d` or any of the four arrow keys, and press `Space` or `Enter` to place on the cursor. While seated, `s` is "move down" rather than "sit"; sit is reachable via `Space`/`Enter` (or `s` from a viewer state). `j/k` remain embedded-chat navigation; `tictactoe::input::handle_arrow` claims all four arrows when seated, otherwise it returns `false` and chat gets up/down for message selection.
- `n` starts a new round for seated players. `l` leaves a seat and resets the board.
- The board UI scales cell size to the available area (`pick_cell_dims` picks from `(11,5)`, `(9,5)`, `(7,3)` and falls back to `(5,3)`); `pick_glyph` selects a 5×5 or 3×3 block-character X/O glyph that fits inside the chosen cell. The compact path renders when `inner.height < 11` or `inner.width < 28`.
- `preferred_game_height` returns `min(area.height * 9 / 20, 19)` — the game caps at 19 rows (enough for the 11×5 cell tier: 17 board rows + 2 border rows) so the embedded chat below it keeps the rest of the active-room area.
- Tic-Tac-Toe has no chip-balance hook; `ActiveRoomBackend::chip_balance` returns `None`.
- Mark wins publish `ActivityGame::TicTacToe` events with the winning mark (`X`/`O`) in `detail`; draws do not publish win activity.

## Poker Runtime
- `PokerTableManager` is process-local and lazily maps each entered `GameRoom.id` to a `PokerService`.
- Restarting the SSH process drops in-memory poker state. Existing open `game_rooms` survive, but re-entering creates a fresh table.
- Poker is a configurable-blind Texas Hold'em-style table: four seats, one 52-card deck, private two-card hole hands, shared flop/turn/river, room-configured blinds, call/check, bet/raise, fold, all-in, side pots, showdown hand ranking, and chip settlement through `ChipService`.
- The service uses one public `watch::Sender<PokerPublicSnapshot>` plus per-user `watch::Sender<PokerPrivateSnapshot>` channels keyed by `user_id`. Public snapshots include seat occupancy, visible stacks, committed chips, pot/current bet, card counts, folded/all-in/pending state, dealer button, board, phase, active seat, and winners. Private snapshots include the current user's hole cards, balance, call amount, minimum raise, and auto check/fold flag.
- The deck and all hole cards live only in `SharedState`; clients never receive other users' hole cards. `publish` lazily prunes orphaned private senders where `receiver_count() == 0`.
- Entering starts as a viewer. `s` or `Enter` sits in the first open seat even during an active hand; mid-hand joiners keep empty hole cards and wait for the next deal. Seated players press `n` to deal when the table is waiting or at showdown, `c`/Space/Enter to check or call when active, `b`/`r` to bet or raise by the selected amount, `[`/`]` or `-`/`+` to adjust that amount, `a` to shove all-in, `x` to toggle auto check/fold, `f` to fold, and `l` to leave a seat.
- The dealer button advances to the next funded occupied seat each new hand. Heads-up uses the button as the small blind; larger tables post blinds left of the button. Pre-flop action starts left of the big blind, later streets start left of the button, and when no further betting is possible because all remaining players are all-in, the service runs out the board and settles showdown.
- Short all-ins smaller than the current call are legal. Short all-in raises update the amount to call but do not reopen raising for players whose action was already closed; those players can only call or fold unless a full raise has reopened action.
- Side pots are built from each distinct committed-chip level. Each pot is awarded only among eligible non-folded contenders for that level; tied winners split each pot, with odd chips assigned deterministically by seat order.
- Showdown currently auto-reveals every non-folded contender's hole cards. Real poker can allow players to muck at showdown instead of showing if they do not want to contest the pot; this app does not model a `show`/`muck` reveal phase yet.
- A seated player who sends no active-room input for 5 minutes is removed from the table when idle outside an active hand. During an active hand, inactivity folds the player and reconciles the hand.
- Poker wires `ActiveRoomBackend::chip_balance`, syncs external chip balance while safely idle, debits chips when they are committed to a pot, credits winning pot shares at settlement, and restores the chip floor for zero-credit losers.
- Positive Poker settlement credits publish `ActivityGame::Poker` events with the credited pot share in `detail`. Split-pot hands can publish one win event per credited winner.
- `poker/ui.rs` mirrors the Blackjack table thresholds and broad layout: dealer/board block on top, felt divider, four seat panels, status line, and key bar. The current user's panel renders private hole cards face-up from the private snapshot; other players render card backs.

## Blackjack UI Invariants
- `blackjack/ui.rs` chooses render tier from area dimensions:
  - Fancy path when `area.height >= FANCY_MIN_HEIGHT` and `area.width >= FANCY_MIN_WIDTH`.
  - Ultra-fancy inside the fancy path when the area also satisfies `ULTRA_FANCY_MIN_*` and can fit all outline seat panels.
  - Compact path otherwise.
- Current constants are `FANCY_MIN_WIDTH = 60`, `FANCY_MIN_HEIGHT = 19`, `ULTRA_FANCY_MIN_WIDTH = 96`, `ULTRA_FANCY_MIN_HEIGHT = 23`, `SEAT_PANEL_WIDTH_OUTLINE = 22`, `SEAT_PANEL_HEIGHT_OUTLINE = 11`, `SEAT_PANEL_WIDTH = 12`, `SEAT_PANEL_HEIGHT = 7`, and `DEALER_BLOCK_HEIGHT = 9`.
- If panel dimensions change, update min thresholds first. The fancy layout indexes fixed vertical chunks and can panic if thresholds allow too-small areas.
- Player-specific info belongs on seats: username, balance, stake chips, cards, total, locked/pending bet, phase, and outcome.
- The bottom info bar should stay minimal: selected chip, phase, countdown/status. Do not duplicate balance/stake/locked bet there.
- Compact mode still uses the generic game frame/sidebar path; fancy modes use the custom table layout.

## Chat Interactions
- `chat_rooms.kind = 'game'` stays in chat state so embedded room chat works.
- Home room-rail rendering skips game rooms, so game-backed rooms do not appear as normal chat rooms or favorites.
- Room entry requests a chat tail; live broadcasts then keep the embedded chat updated like other room-explicit chat flows.

## Asymmetric-Info Game Pattern
- Blackjack and TTT publish one `watch::Sender<Snapshot>` and every session sees the same snapshot. Poker proves the split-channel pattern for games where each user sees a different view.
- Pattern: split the snapshot into a public part and a per-user private part. Service holds one `watch::Sender<PublicSnapshot>` plus a `HashMap<Uuid, watch::Sender<PrivateSnapshot>>` keyed by user_id. Per-session `State` caches both and drains both in `tick()`.
- `RoomGameManager::enter` already receives `user_id`, so the manager can register a private channel for the entering user and bind the receiver into the returned `Box<dyn ActiveRoomBackend>`. Rooms layer never sees the split.
- Cleanup of orphaned private channels (session disconnect drops the receiver but not the sender): prefer lazy GC inside the service's `publish` path — prune entries where `tx.receiver_count() == 0`.
- Keep the deck/un-dealt cards inside `SharedState` only, never put them on any snapshot. Hole cards get sliced into the per-user private snapshot at publish time. Clients never receive secret state they aren't entitled to.

## Room Timeouts
- Blackjack has three runtime timers. The first confirmed bet starts a fixed 30s betting/deal cap; the cap does not restart for later bets and deals immediately if all seated players lock. Player action starts a pace-specific action timer (`Quick` 2m, `Standard` 5m, `Chill` 10m) that auto-stands unresolved hands on expiry and removes those missed-action seats after settlement. Seated player inactivity is a separate 5m active-room idle timer; active-room input refreshes it, idle players leave immediately when safe or after settlement when a live bet blocks immediate removal.
- Poker has two timer types plus a missed-action policy. The per-turn action timer starts whenever `active_seat` is assigned in an action phase and restarts when action moves; the service publishes the deadline and clients render the visible countdown locally instead of receiving per-second service snapshots. On expiry it auto-checks when nothing is owed, otherwise auto-folds. A player who misses 3 turn timers is marked to leave at the nearest safe hand boundary, so one seated player cannot repeatedly consume the full turn clock. The existing 5m seat idle timer remains broader AFK cleanup: idle players leave outside active hands, and during active hands they fold and leave after the hand.
- Tic-Tac-Toe has no service-side turn clock or AFK seat timer. A seated player can keep a seat until they leave, the opponent leaves/resets, or the process restarts; future timeout work should be added explicitly instead of assuming Blackjack/Poker timers apply.

## Known Gaps
- Blackjack table state is not durable across process restart.
- Poker table state is not durable across process restart.
- Poker showdown reveal is simplified: all non-folded contenders auto-show, with no optional muck flow.
- There is no AFK/disconnect cleanup path tied to SSH session lifecycle.

## Test Guidance
- Pure rules in `filter.rs`, `settings.rs`, `blackjack/state.rs`, and key-routing helpers can use inline unit tests.
- Anything that touches `RoomsService`, `GameRoom`, `ChatRoom`, chip balances, or service tasks belongs in `late-ssh/tests/` and must use testcontainers through the existing helpers.
- Do not run `cargo test`, `cargo nextest`, or `cargo clippy` as an agent in this repo. Leave those gates for the human owner.
