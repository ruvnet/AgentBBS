How music works on late.sh

late.sh has two audio surfaces running at once:

  Icecast    a 24/7 house radio. The room votes on the genre.
  YouTube    a shared queue everyone can submit links to.

You pick which one your paired browser plays. The sidebar shows both at a glance: the one you're actually hearing is highlighted, the other is dimmed.

Get audio paired

  Option 1 (recommended): install the CLI

    macOS / Linux / Termux:
      curl -fsSL https://cli.late.sh/install.sh | bash

    Windows PowerShell:
      irm https://cli.late.sh/install.ps1 | iex

    Then run `late` instead of `ssh late.sh`. One process, SSH + local audio. The CLI plays Icecast only.

    Build from source instead:
      git clone https://github.com/mpiorowski/late-sh
      cargo build --release --bin late

    A Nix option is shown in the Home pair modal.

  Option 2: browser pairing

    On Home press P for the pair modal: install hints plus a QR / link. The browser plays whichever source you have selected, including YouTube.

Global keys (work anywhere)
  m                 mute paired client
  + / -             volume up / down

Vote the Icecast genre
  v then 1 / l      Lofi
  v then 2 / a      Ambient
  v then 3 / c      Classic
  The winning genre takes over on the next hourly flip.

Swap which source you hear
  v then x          toggle your paired browser between Icecast and YouTube. Your choice is saved per-user, so a refresh keeps it.

Music Booth (v then v)

  Opens a modal with a URL submit row on top and the queue below.

  Tab               switch focus between submit and queue
  Esc               close

  Submit focus:
    type            paste or type a YouTube URL
    Enter           submit
    ↓ or Ctrl+J     drop into the queue
    Backspace       delete char

  Queue focus:
    j / k or ↑ / ↓  move selection
    PageUp/PageDown jump 8 rows
    + or =          upvote selected item
    - or _          downvote selected item
    0               clear your vote
    s               skip-vote the currently playing track
    ↑ at the top    back to the submit row

  The queue is ordered by score, so upvotes pull tracks toward the front. You can't vote on the track that's already playing, but you can skip-vote it.

Skip the current track
  v then s          add your vote to skip. The track skips once enough paired users agree.
  s                 same thing, while you're in the booth queue.

Track length

  Every track is capped at 1 hour. Shorter videos play to their real end; anything longer (long mixes, live streams, the YouTube fallback) gets cut off at the 1h mark and the queue moves on.";
